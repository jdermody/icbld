# Notes

Simple demo app that uses graphql to query moviedb and shows a searchable list of movies that star "Tom Cruise".

Uses: typescript, react, redux, immutablejs and graphql-request.

Published using parcel to ./publish (and can be opened from the file system):

```parcel build --public-url . --out-dir publish index.html```
